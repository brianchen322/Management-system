# InventoryManagementSystem
This project manages inventory for a local Grocery Store. It is a full CRUD application in Laravel, a PHP framework. It was 
built with a team of four developers. I handled the CRUD and chart.js for the project. This is a single page application that 
allows the user to edit the content through the content-editable attribute. On blur, the results will save to the database. Below
this, charts display with category information for all inventory in the MySQL database.
